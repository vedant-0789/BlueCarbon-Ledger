## 🚩 Problem Statement  
Blue carbon ecosystem restoration is **vital for India’s climate strategy**.  
However, there is **no decentralized MRV system** (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) to ensure:  
- Transparency  
- Accuracy  
- Tamper-proof carbon credit generation  

Existing systems are **centralized, opaque, and exclude local stakeholders**.  

---

## 💡 Our Idea  
A **blockchain-powered MRV system** that:  
- Provides **transparent monitoring & verification** of blue carbon projects.  
- Tokenizes **carbon credits** via smart contracts.  
- Empowers **NGOs, communities, and coastal panchayats**.  
- Integrates **field data from drones, mobile apps, and IoT sensors**.  
- Ensures **tamper-proof carbon credit generation** aligned with India’s climate goals.  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Frontend (FE):** React Native  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum + Layer 2 (Polygon, Arbitrum)  
- **API Layer:** FastAPI (Python) for AI/ML, Node.js for blockchain APIs  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **IoT Integration:** AWS IoT Core / Azure IoT Hub  

---

## 🏗️ System Workflow  
1. **Project Registration** → Upload details (location, area, species, timeline).  
2. **Data Storage** → Immutable storage on blockchain.  
3. **Continuous Monitoring** → IoT sensors, drones, and mobile data updates.  
4. **Analytics & Reporting** → Dashboard (map view, carbon stock, survival %).  
5. **Certification & Credits** → Tokenized carbon credits linked to carbon markets.  
6. **Admin Panel** → NCCR officials review via analytics dashboard.  

---

## ✅ Feasibility & Viability  
- **Practicality**: Blockchain + IoT data capture is already feasible.  
- **Value**: Generates tradable blue carbon credits (new revenue streams).  
- **Sustainability**: Engages NGOs, panchayats, and local communities.  
- **Challenges & Remedies**:  
  - Fake Data → AI verifies geo-tagged drone images.  
  - Manual Verification → Smart contracts + AI pre-screening.  
  - High Certification Costs → Automated MRV reduces effort & cost.  

---

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
### 👥 Social & Community  
- Local communities actively involved.  
- Improves **digital literacy & livelihoods**.  
- Builds **trust via decentralized governance**.  

### 🌱 Environmental  
- Transparent MRV → accurate carbon stock.  
- Boosts **mangrove & seagrass restoration**.  
- Strengthens **Net Zero pathway** for India.  

### 💰 Economic  
- Tokenized carbon credits → new revenue streams.  
- Attracts **climate finance, CSR funds, global markets**.  
- Lowers **transaction costs** vs traditional registries.  

### ⚙ Technological  
- Immutable blockchain ledger.  
- Automated validation with smart contracts.  
- IoT + AI integration for reliable verification.
